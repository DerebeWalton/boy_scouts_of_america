&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advancement program for Boy Scouts of the Boy Scouts of America is symbolized by the earning of seven ranks. The ranks being Scout, 
Tenderfoot, Second-class,First-class, Star, Life, and Eagle which is the highest rank in Scouting.
The advancement program is often considered to be divided into two phases.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first phase from joining to First Class is designed to teach the boy Scoutcraft skills, 
 how to participate in a group and to learn self-reliance. The Scout badge is awarded when the Scout 
 demonstrates a rudimentary knowledge of the Scouting ideals and program. Tenderfoot,
  Second Class and First Class have progressively harder requirements in the areas of Scout craft,
 physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth and Scout Spirit.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second phase of Star, Life and Eagle is designed to develop leadership skills and allow the Scout 
to explore potential vocations and avocations through the merit badge program. The Star and Life ranks require 
that the boy serve in a position of responsibility and perform community service. Except for Scout rank, all ranks 
as well as Eagle Palms require that the candidate participate in a Scoutmaster conference and pass a Board of Review.
